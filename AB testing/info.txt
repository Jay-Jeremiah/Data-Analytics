AB testing 
-It helps evaluating changes or improvements in products or services

A/B Test Basics
A/B testing or split testing originated from the statistical randomised control trials
-Is one of the most popular ways for Business to test:
    new UX features
    new versions of a product
    new versions of an algorithm

A/B testing processes
    1. Hypothesis Of A/B test
    2. A/B Test design | Power Analysis 
    3. Run the A/B Test
    4. Result Analysis | Statistical Significance
    5. Result Analysis | Pratical Significance 

Hypothesis | Primary metric
    Business Hypothesis describes what two products are being
compared and what is the desired impact or difference for the business.
    It highlights the following:
    -how to fix a potential issue in the product
    -a solution that will influence the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

    A way to measure the performance of the product being tested 
in the A/B test for the experimental and control groups. It will be used to identify whether there is a statistical significant difference between the two groups. 
    It should be one primary metric
