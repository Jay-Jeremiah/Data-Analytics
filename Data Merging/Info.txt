JOINS
In most cases, we have data in two databases. But we need to show it one document for proper organisation and easy analysis 

This can be achieved using joins. There are various types of joins which include: left,right,left-anti,right-anti and inner joins.

Note:
    Both tables have to have a common identifier 

Inner Join 
    Returns the matching columns between the two tables basing on the identifier

Left Join
    Returns all the columns in the left table and the matching rows from the right table basing on the identifier.

Right Join
    Returns all the columns in the right table and the matching rows in the left table basing on the identifier.

Left-Anti join
    -Returns all the columns from the left table that do not have a match in the right table
    -Contents of only the left table 

Right-Anti join 
    -Returns all the columns from the right table that do not have a match in the left table.
    -Contents of the right table only.
